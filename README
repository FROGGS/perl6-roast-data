Perl6 Roast Data
    This project contains tools for running the perl6 spec test suite
    (roast) by several different implementations, as well as tracking the
    results of those runs.

    See "perl6_pass_rates" for the data.

    Each implementation's last run is checked in under a corresponding
    ".out" file. Check your implementation's file for any failures or
    unexpected passes.
